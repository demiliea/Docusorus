# Developer Experience Console

Welcome to the DevX console. This interactive panel lets you:

1. Authenticate against our Keycloak realm.
2. Obtain your JSON Web Token (JWT).
3. Copy a ready-made `curl` command with the token injected.

## Authentication flow

When you press **Login with Keycloak**, you'll be redirected to our identity provider. After entering your credentials and approving access for the *sam* client, you'll be returned here. The console will then:

- Show your username and token expiry time.
- Display the raw JWT (with a handy copy button).
- Generate a sample `curl` request using the token in the `Authorization` header.

The component automatically refreshes the token so the snippet remains valid. If the refresh fails you'll see an error message and can retry logging in.
