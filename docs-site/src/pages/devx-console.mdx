# Developer Experience Console

Use the console below to authenticate with Keycloak and instantly get a JWT-powered code snippet you can use in your API calls.

## How it works

1. Click **Login with Keycloak** â€“ you will be redirected to our identity provider.
2. Enter your credentials and approve access for the *sam* client.
3. Once redirected back, the console:
   - Retrieves your OpenID Connect access token (JWT)
   - Shows its expiry time and lets you copy it with one click
   - Generates a ready-made `curl` command injecting the token in the `Authorization` header.

The token is refreshed silently while the page stays open, so the snippet remains valid.

> **Tip:** If you see an error message, the token has likely expired or could not be refreshed. Use the **Retry login** button to start a new session.
