# Developer Experience Console

The Developer Console provides JWT token management tools and code snippets for API integration. It's accessible without authentication but becomes fully functional when you sign in.

## How it works

### Without Sign In (Demo Mode)
- View placeholder JWT tokens and code examples
- Copy template curl commands for testing
- See the structure of JWT-based API authentication
- All functionality is available for learning and reference

### With Sign In (Full Functionality)
1. Click **Sign In** to authenticate with Keycloak
2. Enter your credentials and approve access
3. Once authenticated, the console provides:
   - Your actual JWT access token with copy functionality
   - Real-time token expiration monitoring
   - Personalized curl commands with your token
   - Token payload inspection and debugging tools
   - Automatic token refresh while the page is open

## Features

- **Token Display**: View your JWT token (or placeholder in demo mode)
- **Code Generation**: Ready-to-use curl commands
- **Token Management**: Copy tokens and monitor expiration
- **Developer Tools**: Inspect token payload and metadata
- **Seamless Experience**: All content accessible without authentication

> **Tip:** Sign in to unlock personalized JWT tokens and live API testing capabilities. If you encounter errors, use the retry login button to refresh your session.
